2001-06-26:
  * Added Sven de Marothy's screenshot patch. It allows taking screenshots
    by pressing F11.

2001-06-10 (Thomas Huth):
  * Added sound support. Does not yet work perfect, but at least there
    are some noises now :-) (Use option --sound to enable it).

2001-06-01 (Thomas Huth):  *** Version 0.05a ***
  * Added joystick emulation.
  * Added Stefan's patch for ST-LOW res on big-endian machines,
    his patch for also leaving Hatari by pressing F12, and
    his fullscreen patch.
  * Changed all tabulator characters in the source to spaces.

2001-05-27 (Thomas Huth):  *** Version 0.04a ***
  * Added Stefan Berndtsson's patch for big-endian machines.
    Hatari now runs also with non-x86 Linux machines! Thanks Stefan!
  * Rewrote the ST-LOW resolution conversation routines in C
    => ST-LOW now works!
  * Added some of the WinSTon patches Paul Bates recently published
    at the WinSTon BBS (Thanks to Ladislav Adamec for the hint).
  * Cleaned up the source tree a little bit.

2001-04-03 (Thomas Huth):  *** Version 0.03a ***
