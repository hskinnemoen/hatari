 2) What is this?
 ----------------

Hatari is an Atari ST emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, BeOS, Mac-OSX and
other Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
Unlike most other open source ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware
of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games
and demos.


 3) Compiling and installing
 ---------------------------

For using Hatari, you need to have installed the following libraries:

- The SDL library (http://www.libsdl.org)
- The zlib compression library (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

Don't forget to also install the header files of these libraries for compiling
Hatari (some Linux distributions use separate development packages for these
header files)!

For compiling Hatari, you currently need GNU-C and GNU-Make. Please note that
GNU-Make is often called "gmake" instead of "make" on non-Linux systems.
To configure the build process, you currently have two options: You can either
use the supplied configure script (type "./configure --help" to see the
options) or you can edit the file Makefile.cnf manually. Don't forget to use
some good CFLAGS for the compiler optimizations, e.g. run "configure" in the
following way:

 CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer" ./configure

Then you can compile Hatari by typing "make" (or "gmake"). If all works fine,
you'll get the executable "hatari" in the src/ subdirectory.


 4) Running Hatari
 -----------------

For information about how to use the running emulator, please read the file
doc/manual.html. Here are just some hints for the impatient people:
Before you can run the emulator, you need a TOS ROM image that should be
stored as "tos.img" in the data directory of the emulator (see the variable
DATADIR in Makefile.cnf).
While the emulator is running, you can open the configuration menu by
pressing F12, the F11 key will toggle fullscreen/windowed mode.
Pressing ALTGR-q will quit the emulator.
