 Code from other projects
 ------------------------

The initial Hatari source code was based on two main sources:

- Most of the hardware emulation comes from the WinSTon sourcecode
  written by Paul Bates (see: http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/winston/).

- The CPU core has been taken from UAE which has been written by Bernd Schmidt
  and others (http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/).

Beside these two main sources, Hatari also uses some code from other projects:

- Some parts (e.g. the blitter emulation) have been taken from the emulator
  STonX that has been written by Marinos Yannikos and Martin Griffiths
  (http://stonx.sourceforge.net/).

- Some code (e.g. the scancode keyboard mapping) has been taken from the
  emulator Aranym (http://aranym.atari.org/).

- The code for decompressing ZIP files (unzip.c) has been taken from Gilles
  Vollant's miniunzip program (http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html).

- The routines for saving and loading the ASCII configuration file (cfgopts.c)
  have originally been written by Jeffry J. Brickley.
