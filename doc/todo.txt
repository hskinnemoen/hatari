                                  TO-DO list


If you think that you can help with one of the TO-DO list items, please get in
touch with us:

- Improve FDC emulation (e.g. read-track and write-track commands do not work
  right yet).

- Improve support for .DIM disk images (support also disks that have been
  imaged with the "Get sectors: used" option).

- Add support for .STT disk images (created with the STEEM disk image program).

- Add support for Pasti .STX disk images. (See http://pasti.fxatari.com/)

- Improve PSG sound emulation (it sounds not very accurate with some games
  and demos compared to a real ST).
  Check if one of the other open-source PSG emulators could be used as a
  good replacement (STSoundLibrary by Leonard, STonX, Castaway CE, SC68,
  STsndplay or psgplay by NoCrew, ...).

- Fix IKBD emulation (e.g. some games like "Big Run" have problems with the
  joystick fire button).

- Add proper emulation of IO registers wait-state cycles emulation.

- Add accurate cycles emulation for DIVU and DIVS instructions
  (see: http://pasti.fxatari.com/68kdocs/div68kCycleAccurate.c).

- Upgrade the CPU core of Hatari to the latest WinUAE or E-UAE CPU core.

- Fix MFP emulation (e.g. "Froggies over the fence" does not work yet).

- Improve MIDI emulation (MIDI-Input ...).

- Get the games/demos working that are marked as non-working in the manual.

- Improve TT and/or Falcon emulation

- Add proper Blitter timing emulation.

- Check if Blitter can generate an interrupt and if so add its emulation.

- Fix the problems with horizontal STE scrolling (Zool, Mind Rewind demo, ...)

- Add x3 and x4 zooming routines for ST-Low resolution.

- Include some fancy zooming routines like 2xSaI or Super-Eagle.

- Add support for hardware accelerated zooming with SDL YUV overlays or
  OpenGL.

- Improve shifter emulation (full screen effects, sync scrolling, ...)

- Improve the built-in debugger.

- Extend the GEMDOS HD emulation to support more than one drive.
