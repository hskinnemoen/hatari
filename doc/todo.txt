Hatari TO-DO list
=================

If you think that you can help with one of the TO-DO list items, please get
in touch with us.

Emulation improvements
----------------------

- Improve FDC emulation (e.g. read-track and write-track commands do not work
  right yet).

- Improve disk image formats support:
  - Add support for .STT images (created with the STEEM disk image program).
  - Add support for Pasti .STX images (See http://pasti.fxatari.com/).
  - Support .DIM images created with the "Get sectors: used" option.

- Real HD 6301 (keyboard processor of the ST) emulation?
  (Current special casing is enough for all known demos using 6301)

- Upgrade the CPU core of Hatari to the latest WinUAE or E-UAE CPU core.

- Get the games/demos working that are marked as non-working in the manual.

- Improve TT and/or Falcon emulation

- Extend the GEMDOS HD emulation to support more than one drive.

- Add SCSI hard disk emulation for Falcon/TT mode.

- Add SCC serial port emulation for Falcon/TT mode.


Other Hatari functionality improvements
---------------------------------------

- Add x3 and x4 zooming routines for ST-Low resolution.

- Include some fancy zooming routines like 2xSaI or Super-Eagle.

- Add support for hardware accelerated zooming with SDL YUV overlays or
  OpenGL.

- Improve the built-in debugger (single stepping etc).

- Improve directory handling.  By default the directory config values
  should be empty in which case the code will at run-time decide to use
  current directory, but not modify the path config setting.  Currently
  screenshots & anim go to current dir (cannot be configured), whereas
  memsave, sound recording, printer & midi & serial & output and log
  output go to file specified in config file.
