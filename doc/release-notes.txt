                                Release Notes


 Version 0.80 (2005-10-12):
 --------------------------

- Support for STE hardware emulation: STE palette, STE shifter (horizontal fine
  scrolling, split screen effects), DMA sound and STE joypads.
  See the manual for a list of working STE applications/games/demos.
- Hatari can now emulate up to 14 MiB ST RAM instead of only 4 MiB.
- Support for parallel port joysticks.
- Improved GEMDOS HD emulation (added Fattrib() call).
- Adding and removing a GEMDOS or ACSI hard disk should now work correctly.
- Re-factoring of the screen conversion functions.
- Improved manual: Now with screenshots of the options dialogs.


 Version 0.70 (2005-06-05):
 --------------------------

- As always: Code cleanup and bug fixes.
- No more crashes when a program tries to access illegal sector numbers.
- Improved built-in ROM cartridge.
- Rewrote the IO memory emulation code -> Better compatibility.
- Support for TOS 1.06 and TOS 1.62
- Emulated CPU can now also be run at 16 MHz or 32 MHz.
- File selection dialog scrollable with mouse wheel or cursor keys, too.
- Hatari now works on 64-bit host CPUs, too.
- Floppy disk images can now be set writable/write-protected in the GUI.
- Hatari can now also load a global configuration file (e.g. /etc/hatari.cfg).
- Configurable logging functions.


 Version 0.60 (2004-12-19):
 --------------------------

- Again some code cleanup and bug fixes.
- Window/fullscreen mode is now correctly initialized from the configuration
  file.
- Added --window command line option to force a start in window mode.
- Added alert boxes to show warnings, errors and information messages.
- PC mouse pointer is now better in sync with the ST mouse pointer.
- It's now possible to load an alternative cartridge image file.


 Version 0.50 (2004-07-26):
 --------------------------

- A lot of internal code cleanup and bug fixes.
- Added a dialog for creating new blank floppy disk images.
- The source code has been optimized for better emulation speed.
- Added RS232 emulation (still very experimental and not very well tested! It
  seems not to work reliable yet. Help for debugging is very appreciated!).
- Some bugs in the 68000 emulation have been fixed.
- The emulator now checks for double bus errors and stops the emulation if
  necessary (instead of crashing the emulator).
- Timer-D is now patched correctly again.
- The old font has been replaced by two new fonts so that the GUI now looks
  better in high resolutions.
- The fonts are now linked into the executable.
- Added support for DIM floppy disk images.


 Version 0.45 (2003-10-30):
 --------------------------

- This is just a minor release on the way to version 0.50. It is not very
  well tested, so be warned!
- New build system (with a "configure" shell script).
- A disk image destroying bug in the MSA compression function has been fixed.
- It is now possible to redirect the printer output into a file.
- Experimental MIDI output support.
- Added the possibility to save memory snap shots.
- Pending HBL and VBL interrupts are now emulated correctly (I hope).
- Some speed improvements.
- GEMDOS HD emulation now also works with EmuTOS.


 Version 0.40 (2003-07-11):
 --------------------------

- Support for ZIP and GZIP compressed disk images!
- Configuration file support for loading and saving the emulator settings.
- Hatari now works on machines with Sparc CPUs, too.
- Fixed a problem that slowed down the emulator in monochrome mode when using
  TOS 2.06.
- Inverted monochrome mode is now supported, too (some games like Maniac
  Mansion use this).
- Added Mega-ST compatible real time clock (RTC) emulation.
- The GEMDOS HD emulation has been improved (it now also works with lower-case
  file names) and many bugs have been fixed there.
- Improved keyboard mapping (added mapping via PC keyboard scancode and via
  reloadable mapping files).
- The screen rendering routines have been generalized (less differences between
  windowed and fullscreen mode).
- Hatari can now be cross-compiled, too. You can even compile it for MiNT now.
  However, it does not run very well there yet.
- Support for RAM TOS images.
- Improved memory mapping (the different memory regions should now behave much
  more like on a real ST).
- Improved M68k exceptions (bus errors and exception cycle timings).
- Fixed some bugs in the extended VDI resolution mode (now it is working with
  EmuTOS, too).
- Some games that poll the write-protection signal of the FDC to check for
  disk changes should now be working, too.


 Version 0.30 (2003-03-12):
 --------------------------

- Some parts of the code accessed the SR directly to read the IPL -
  however the UAE CPU core only updates the SR when doing a MakeSR() first.
  So this is done in the affected code parts now, too.
- The IPL wasn't raised when a MFP interrupt occured - fixed now.
- Full screen resolution for ST-Low can now be selected from the screen setup
  dialog.
- The IKBD emulation does not longer duplicate joystick fire buttons when
  a game tries to use both, joystick and mouse 
- Improved audio timer function - the code should now be a little bit faster.
- Resynced Hatari's UAE CPU core with UAE 0.8.22 - this fixes some bugs in 68k
  instructions like ABCD and SBCD.
- Added patches for TOS 2.05 so that this TOS version should now work, too.
- Rewrote TOS patching routine. It is much more flexible now.
- Removed 0xa0ff opcode for VDI resolutions; using GEMDOS_OPCODE now instead.
- Fixed MMU RAM size configuration bug.
- Rewrote some more screen conversion functions in C.
- When a bus or address error occurred, the PC was often not set to the
  right exception handler routine. This has been fixed now.


 Version 0.25 (2002-12-30):
 --------------------------

- Patches for big endian systems (Spectrum 512 pictures are now working there).
- Hatari now also compiles and runs under Mac OS X.
- Blitter emulation has been added.
- There is now the possibility to save YM or WAV sounds.
- Big VDI resolutions (e.g. 800x600) are now supported, too.


 Version 0.20 (2002-02-18):
 --------------------------

- Added graphical user interface for configuration of the emulator settings.
- Real joysticks can now also be used to simulate the ST joysticks.
- Yet another bugfix for BeOS (lseek again...)
- Support for hard disk images.


 Version 0.11 (2001-10-10):
 --------------------------

- High level (GEMDOS) harddisk emulation.
- ST-Med/ST-Low mixed mode now works.


 Version 0.10 (2001-08-16):
 --------------------------

- Improved CPU cycles emulation.
- Added Spec512 support.
- Some keyboard shortcuts.
- Added the possibility to switch between fullscreen and window mode.
- ST Medium resolution conversion routine.
- Built-in debugger.
- Added possibility to grab screenshots.
- Sound support (not working very well yet).


 Version 0.05 (2001-06-01):
 --------------------------

- Joystick emulation via cursor keys.
- ST-LOW resolution conversion routine is now working on big-endian machines.


 Version 0.04 (2001-05-27):
 --------------------------

- Added Stefan Berndtsson's patch for big-endian machines.
  Hatari now runs also with non-x86 Linux machines! Thanks Stefan!
- Rewrote the ST-LOW resolution conversion routines in C ==> ST-LOW now works!
- Added some of the WinSTon patches Paul Bates recently published
  at the WinSTon BBS (Thanks to Ladislav Adamec for the hint).
- Cleaned up the source tree a little bit.


 Version 0.03 (2001-04-03):
 --------------------------

- Rewrote some more assembler functions. FDC emulation now works!
- SDL Keyboard code finished and included a SDL-Key -> ST-Scancode table.
- Added mouse support.


 Version 0.02 (2001-03-28):
 --------------------------

- Added very simple SDL support.
- Rewrote a lot of assembler functions in C (e.g. intercept.c).
- Adapted the UAE CPU. Now Hatari is able to boot a TOS 1.0x ROM, the
  Desktop shows up, but no mouse and keyboard interaction yet.


 Version 0.01 (2001-03-21):
 --------------------------
- Made the WinSTon source code compilable with GNU-C.
- Added the UAE CPU sources.
