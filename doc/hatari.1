.SH "NAME"
hatari \- Atari ST(e) emulator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B hatari
.RI  [options]
.RI  [diskimage]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hatari is an Atari ST(e) emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and other
Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
.PP
With hatari one can run games, demos or applications written for Atari
ST or Atari STE. It supports the commonly used *.st and *.msa disk
images and hard disk emulation.
.PP
To run the emulator a TOS ROM image is needed. EmuTOS, a free
implementation of TOS is shipped with hatari. Since it is not yet
fully compatible with the original TOS some programs won't run
correctly with this. Because of this it is recommended to use a TOS
ROM from a real Atari.

The shortcut keys can be configured in the configuration file.
The default settings are:
.TP
.B AltGr + a
record animation
.TP
.B AltGr + g
grab a screenshot
.TP
.B AltGr + i
boss key: leave full screen mode and iconify window
.TP
.B AltGr + j
activate joystick emulation via cursor keys
.TP
.B AltGr + m
(un-)lock the mouse into the window
.TP
.B AltGr + r
(warm) reset the ST
.TP
.B AltGr + c
coldreset the ST (same as the original power switch)
.TP
.B AltGr + s
enable/disable sound
.TP

quit the emulator
.TP
.B AltGr + x
toggle normal/max speed
.TP
.B AltGr + y
enable/disable sound recording
.TP
.B AltGr + k
save memory snapshot
.TP
.B AltGr + l
load memory snapshot
.TP
.B F11
toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode
.TP
.B F12 
activate the hatari command GUI
.br
You may need to hold SHIFT down while in windowed mode.
.TP
.B Pause
will go to the debugger if it was activated with the -\-debug option

.SH Emulated Atari ST keyboard
All other keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so
pressing SPACE on your PC will result in an emulated press of the
SPACE key on the ST. The following keys have special meanings:
.TP
.B  Alt
will act as the ST's ALTERNATE key
.TP
.B  left Ctrl
will act as the ST's CONTROL key
.TP
.B  Page Up
will emulate the ST's HELP key
.TP
.B  Page Down
will emulate the ST's UNDO key
.PP
.B AltGr
will act as
.B Alternate
as well as long as you do not press it together with a Hatari hotkey
combination. 

The 
.B right Ctrl
key is used as the fire button of the emulated joystick when you turn
on joystick emulation via keyboard. 

The cursor keys will act as the cursor keys on the Atari ST as long as
joystick emulation via keyboard has been turned off.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

Debian project and later modified by Thomas Huth to suit the latest
version of Hatari.
