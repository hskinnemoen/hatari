.SH "NAME"
hatari \- Atari ST emulator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B hatari
.RI  [options]
.RI  [diskimage]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hatari is an Atari ST emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and other Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
.PP
A lot of code is adapted from WinSTon, an Atari ST emulator for MS Windows.
.PP
With hatari one can run games, demos or applications written for Atari ST. It supports the commonly used .st and .msa disk images and hard disk emulation.
.PP
To run the emulator a TOS ROM image is needed. EmuTOS, a free implementation of TOS is shipped with hatari. Since it is not yet fully compatible with the original TOS some programs won't run correctly with this. Because of this it is recommended to use a TOS ROM from a real Atari.

.SH Emulated Atari ST keyboard
All other keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so pressing SPACE on your PC will result in an emulated press of the SPACE key on the ST. The following keys have special meanings:
.TP
.B  Alt
will act as the ST's ALTERNATE key
.TP
.B  left Ctrl
will act as the ST's CONTROL key
.TP
.B  Page Up
will emulate the ST's HELP key
.TP
.B  Page Down
will emulate the ST's UNDO key
.PP
.B AltGr
will act as
.B Alternate
as well as long as you do not press it together with a Hatari hotkey combination. 

The 
.B right Ctrl
key is used as the fire button of the emulated joystick when you turn on joystick emulation via keyboard. 

The cursor keys will act as the cursor keys on the Atari ST as long as joystick emulation via keyboard has been turned off.
