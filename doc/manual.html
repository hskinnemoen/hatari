<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<a name="General description"></a><h3>General description</h3>
<p>
Hatari is an Atari ST emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and other
Systems which are supported by the SDL library.
The emulator is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (GPL).
</p>
<p>
The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari
in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having
quite a lot of CPU power at that time. See Appendix B for details on emulation
in general.
</p>
<p>
Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware
of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games
and demos. Of course you can run normal GEM applications with Hatari, too.
Recent versions of Hatari even feature basic STE, TT and Falcon emulation.
</p>

</p>


<a name="System requirements"></a><h3>System requirements</h3>

<p> Hatari currently has the following system requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a fast PC (&gt;300MHz, for Falcon and TT emulation even faster) </li>
  <li>some sort of Unix (preferable <a href="http://www.linux.org/">GNU/Linux</a>)
  </li>
  <li>the SDL library (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>)</li>
  <li>the zLib (<a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>)
for support of ZIP-packed disk images (*.zip and *.gz)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<a name="Compiling and running"></a><h2>Compiling and running</h2>

<a name="Compiling Hatari"></a><h3>Compiling Hatari</h3>

<p> First, you need the SDL library, you can get it at:
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>. Most
distributions already ship a suitable version.
Make sure to install the appropriate header files as well often called
"libsdl-dev" or the like.
</p>
<p> Second, you need the zLib compression library. You can get it from <a
 href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>
but the version shipped with your distribution will be sufficient in
most cases. Make sure to have the header files
for it installed as well.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you need the GNU C compiler and (GNU) Make, too!
</p>
<p> Change to the hatari/ directory and adapt the configuration file
<span class="file">Makefile.cnf</span> to suite your system.
Alternatively, you can use the supplied configure script to auto-detect
all parameters (type " <span class="commandline">./configure --help</span>"
to see the options of the script).
Don't forget to use some good CFLAGS for the compiler optimizations, e.g.
run <span class="commandline">configure</span> in the following way:
</p>
<p>
 <kbd> CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer" ./configure</kbd>
</p>
<p>
Then compile Hatari by typing <span class="commandline">make</span>.
If all
works fine, you'll get the executable <span class="commandline">hatari</span>
in the src/ subdirectory.
</p>

<a name="Installation of a TOS ROM"></a><h3>Installation of a TOS ROM</h3>

<p>
Before you can start Hatari, you have to copy a TOS ROM image to the data
directory (the data directory is specified
in the configuration file <span class="file">Makefile.cnf</span>) and
rename it to <span class="commandline">tos.img</span>, or use the
<span class="commandline">--tos</span> command line option to tell
Hatari where to find a TOS ROM.
Hatari needs a TOS ROM image because this contains the operating system
of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it is not possible to ship an original ROM
image with the Hatari package since these images are still copyrighted.
But you can easily create an image with a real ST and one of those various
ROM-image programs for the ST (search for &quot;TOSDUMP&quot; with your
favourite internet search engine). If your old ST does not work anymore, you
can also try to search the internet directly for corresponding TOS ROM image,
but don't ask the Hatari team where to get one. </p>
<p> Another solution is EmuTOS, which is also shipped with the official
release versions of Hatari. EmuTOS is an open-source TOS clone. You can find
it at:
<a href="http://emutos.sourceforge.net/">http://emutos.sourceforge.net/</a>.
It is not the best solution for playing games or running other old software
due to compatibility issues, but it's free and compatible with Hatari. </p>
<p>If you do not specify a TOS image on the commandline nor can Hatari
find a suitable TOS image in the default dir, you'll get the chance to
select a TOS image file from the GUI. </p>

<a name="Installation of the binary"></a><h3>Installation of the binary</h3>

<p> Type <span class="commandline">make install</span> as root to do a
systemwide installation. In this case it is recommended
to set the DATADIR variable in Makefile.cnf to a proper value. <tt>/usr/local/share/hatari</tt>
is a good value in that case.</p>
<p>The Hatari executable should now be in your PATH and accessible from
anywhere.</p>
<p> When you finally have got a TOS image, try starting Hatari with the
option <span class="commandline">--help</span> to find out more about
its command line parameters. </p>

<a name="Running Hatari for the first time"></a><h3>Running Hatari for the first time</h3>

<p> Now type <span class="commandline">hatari</span> to run the
emulator for the first time. If all goes
well, you should now be presented with a window showing you the
familiar
little green desktop of the Atari ST. Press <span class="key">F12</span>
to turn on the GUI to
configure Hatari to suit your needs, press <span class="key">F11</span>
to toggle windowed and fullscreen mode. </p>

<p>
 First you can select the CPU type here. Here are some important hints for
 choosing the correct CPU type:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Atari ST and STE have only been shipped with a 68000 CPU, so for best
  compatibility with old programs, choose this CPU type.
 </li>
 <li>
  Atari TT and Falcon computers were using the 68030 CPU, so you should switch
  either to 68020 or 68020+FPU when you want to use TT or Falcon mode.
  (The 68020 and 68030 were pretty much the same apart from some minor details).
 </li>
 <li>
  TOS 1.0x only works with 68000, while TOS 3.0x and 4.0x work only with a CPU
  &gt;= 68020.
 </li>
 <li>
  68010 and 68040 have never been used in official Atari computers, so don't
  use these CPU types unless you've got some good reasons.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Beside the CPU type, you can also choose the machine type to emulate.
 The ST was the very first 16/32-bit computer from Atari. Most old games
 and demos require an ST. The STE was introduced some years later and had
 some advanced hardware features. There are not that much demos and games that
 really require an STE but since most normal ST games/demos also work with the
 STE, it's normally save to always work in STE mode.
 <br>
 TT and Falcon are more advanced, but they are not as compatible to the ST as
 the STE was. So many old games and demos do not work with these machine types
 anymore. There were only very few programs that were made for the TT
 exclusively, while there were some interesting games and demos specially made
 for the Falcon.
 <em>Note:</em> TT and Falcon emulation are very incomplete. They may not work
 very well.
</p>
<p>
 For STE emulation a STE compatible TOS image, e.q. version 1.06, 1.62 or
 2.x, is strongly recommended. For TT emulation you need TOS 3.0x and for Falcon
 emulation you need TOS 4.0x. EmuTOS can be used on all machine types.
</p>
<p>
 Select the CPU clock you want to use. 8Mhz is ST standard and the most
 compatible. Use 16MHz for Mega STE and Falcon emulation.
 The CPU in the TT was clocked with 32 MHz.
</p>
<p>With the &quot;Slower but more compatible CPU&quot; option, you can enable
 the emulation of 68k address errors and the CPU prefetch buffer. This is needed
 for best compatibility, but it slows down emulation a little bit so you can
 disable it if you don't need it.</p>
<p>You can also enable/disable Blitter emulation here. The Blitter is a custom
 chip that accelerates some graphical operations. This switch only toggles the
 Blitter in plain ST mode. In STE mode, the Blitter is always enabled (since all
 STEs have been sold with a Blitter chip).</p>
<p>If you enable the &quot;Real time clock emulation&quot; switch, a RTC will
 be emulated based on the time of the host computer. Note that you need at least
 TOS 1.02 for proper RTC emulation, TOS 1.00 does not support this.</p>
<p>The Timer-D patch changes the Timer-D initialization from TOS. TOS uses
 the MFP timer D as a baudrate generator for RS232. However, the TOS default
 value slows down the emulation. The patch gives you a better performance.
 It is normally save to enable the patch, but if you encounter a program that
 does not work, you can try to disable the patch to see if it works then.</p>
<p>Select if you want to use slow FDC emulation. Slow is more compatible esp.
 with games and demos that use custom loaders.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> These parameters are very sensitive to the emulated
ST and it is strongly recommended to
reset the emulated ST after changing these options.</p>

<p>Use the upper dialog to choose which floppy disks should be emulated
in the disk drives.</p>

<p>You can use most standard Atari ST disk image files. See the chapter
"Floppy disk images"
for details.</p>
<p>Click on the button <span class="button">Browse</span> next to the

You may select and browse zipped disk images as well.</p>

<p>
The fileselector looks like this:

</div>

<p>Click on <span class="button">Eject</span> to eject a disk image
from the emulated drive. The emulated ST will act as if had no floppy
disk in its drive.</p>
<p>You can specify a default directory where Hatari will start to
browse the filesystem.</p>
<p>
Check the "Auto insert B" option if you want Hatari to be smart and
insert the second disk of a two disk game automatically.
Some games then use the second drive automatically.
In the case that a game is not able to find the disk in the second drive,
you have to insert the second disk in drive A: manually when prompted.
<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> This option only works properly if the file name of the
first disks ends with an 'a' before the extension and the second disk name
ends with a 'b'.
</p>
<p>If you need to create a new blank disk image, click on <span
 class="button">Create disk image</span>.
Parameters for the new image can be set in the following dialog. Click
on <span class="create">create</span> to create the image or on <span
 class="button">back</span> to get back to the
disk dialog.
</p>
<p>
After clicking <span class="button">create</span>, a fileselector
appears. You can browse the filesystem now. Select the target
directory, click beside File:
and type in a name for the new disk image. The name should terminate
with .st or .msa.
</p>
<p>Hatari can currently create plain .ST and .MSA disk images
exclusively.</p>
<p>You can choose if you want Hatari to writeprotect your disks. Atari ST virii can spread on disk images too so it is ok to
enable the write protection option. However you can't save highscores or games to your disk images then.</p>
<p>Use the lower dialog to change the harddisk settings.</p>
<p>You can select a harddrive image for harddrive emulation via image
file here or you may select
a directory of your local filesystem to be emulated as the ST's
harddrive.</p>
<p>Check "Boot from HD" if you want Hatari to execute the AUTO folder
on the harddrive.
This option is checked by default if you specify a harddrive image or a
directory via the command line.</p>

<a name="The Joystick Dialog"></a><h4>The Joystick Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/joystick.png" width="320" height="288" alt="Hatari's GUI - the joystick dialog">
</div>

<p>In this dialog, you can configure the emulated joysticks.
With the upper two arrows, you can choose the joystick which you want to
configure.</p>
<p>Joystick 1 is the normal ST joystick port and 99.9% of all ST games
use this port.
Joystick 0 emulates a joystick plugged into the ST mouse port
and is often used in games for two players.</p>
<p>With STE joypad A and B, you can enable the emulation of Jaguar joypads
which are plugged in the enhanced joystick ports of the Atari STE.
Only very few STE games support these joypads, so you often won't need this.</p>
<p>Finally, Hatari also emulates joysticks which were plugged on the parallel
port with a special adapter on a real ST. These were used in some few
multi-player games like &quot;Gauntlet 2&quot;.</p>
<p>For each ST joystick, choose whether you want to disable it,
use the keyboard for emulation or use a real PC joystick.</p>
<p>For keyboard emulation, you can select the keys by pressing the
<span class="button">Define keys</span> button. You will be prompted to press
the keys for up, down, left, right and fire.</p>
<p>If you want to use a real PC joystick for the emulation, you should connect
it to your PC before you start Hatari. Then you can choose the joystick with
the two lower arrows.</p>
<p>Check the &quot;Enable autofire&quot; option if you are too lazy to pound
on the fire button in shoot'em-up games. However, this option only works with
certain games. In some other games, it gets worse if you enable this option.</p>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/screen.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Hatari's GUI - the screen dialog">
</div>

<p>
 Here you control the video output of the emulated Atari.
</p>
<p>
 Check &quot;Fullscreen&quot; to run Hatari fullscreen, default is windowed.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Use Borders&quot; toggles the displaying of the borders around the ST
 screen. Some few demos/games use the borders for displaying additional
 graphics. However, when you enable this option, it increases CPU computing
 time, so you should not enable it if you have a slow computer.
 Please note that this option also only affects the ST and STE mode, TT and
 Falcon modes are always displayed without borders.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Zoom ST-Low res.&quot; controls wether Hatari doubles the low
 resolutions. For example Hatari then zooms the ST low resolution 320x200 to
 640x400 and it doubles 384x267 (ST low with borders) to 768x534.
 Note that zooming also takes a lot of CPU computing time and should not be
 enabled on slow computers.
</p>
<p>
 &quot;Force 8Bpp&quot; will force Hatari to use an 8bit video mode.
 You don't need this for modern video cards.
</p>
<p>
 The &quot;Frame Skip&quot; option can be set to speed up the emulator
 if it is running too slow on your system. 1 to 8 frames will be dropped
 after each frame that has been drawn. Disable frame-skip if you have a
 fast computer.
</p>
<p>
 You can select which sort of monitor to use. This option depends on the
 machine type which you have selected in the &quot;System options&quot;
 dialog. In ST and STE mode, you can choose between monochrome mode (select
 &quot;Mono&quot;) and color mode (select one of the other monitor types).
 Note that when you select &quot;TV&quot; and use zoomed low resolution or
 switch to ST medium resolution, you will get a TV-like screen rendering
 which is a little bit faster but darker compared to the normal &quot;RGB&quot;
 monitor mode. Switching between mono and a color monitor acts like a monitor
 switch on a real ST - so beware, this will reboot your emulated system!<br>
 In TT mode, you can only choose between TT-high resolution (&quot;Mono&quot;)
 and normal modes (select one of the other monitor types).
 Finally the Falcon mode supports all four types of monitors. Note that most
 Falcon demos/games require a RGB or TV mode and do not work with VGA.
</p>
<p>
Extended GEM resolutions will emulate some sort of extended graphics
card in the emulated ST giving you larger resolutions and a higher
colordepth in GEM. Select a resolution and color depth. Check to
activate. It will disable all other video options mentioned above.
Uncheck to get back to a normal ST behaviour.<br>
<em>Note:</em> Using an extended resolution will only work with GEM
conformant applications. 99% of all games and demos will not run if you
activate any extended resolution here.
</p>
<p>Click <span class="button">Capture Screen</span> to create a
screenshot in .BMP format to the current working directory or click <span
 class="button">Record Animation</span> to record a sequence of single

<a name="The Keyboard Dialog"></a><h4>The Keyboard Dialog</h4>

<div class="floatimage">
<img src="images/keyboard.png" width="400" height="192" alt="Hatari's GUI - the keyboard dialog">
</div>

<p>Here you can select the keyboard mapping to use. Two different mappings
 called &quot;Symbolic&quot; and &quot;Scancode&quot; are predefined.</p>
<p>&quot;Symbolic&quot; tries to map the symbolic values of your PC keys
 to the ST keys. It should be working pretty good on all systems as long
 as your keyboard layout looks close to the standard english keyboard
 layout. However, you might experience some problems with special keys like
 brackets etc.</p>
<p>&quot;Scancode&quot; uses the scancode values of your PC keys for keyboard
 mapping. This only works on certain architectures like Linux where the
 scancodes are similar to the ST scancodes (e.g. it does not work on Mac OS X).
 If it works on your system, this often gives better results than the symbolic
 mapping. Note that you also need a TOS version with the right language
 (e.g. use a French TOS if you are using a French keyboard).</p>
<p>You can also load a custom keyboard mapping file here if you wish. Please
 note that the custom keyboard mapping will use the &quot;symbolic&quot;
 mapping for all keys that are not defined by your map file. Have a look
 at the supplied example mapfile (keymap-sample.txt) to see how to create
 your own keyboard mapping.</p>

<p>Here you can control the sound subsystem.</p>
<p>Check if you want emulated sound at all. Emulation is faster if
sound emulation is turned off.</p>
<p>3 frequencies from low to high quality are available. Experiment a
little bit to find out which fits best for your setup.
Medium quality will work ok in most cases.</p>
<p>You can select to record a piece of sound here. Check which format
to use and click the button. It is a toggle button so
you will need to return to the GUI to switch sound recording off again.</p>

<a name="The Devices Dialog"></a><h4>The Devices Dialog</h4>

<p>Check here if you want to enable experimental printer support. See
the chapter "Emulated printer" for details.</p>

<div class="image" align="center">
<img src="images/devices.png" width="768" height="534" alt="Hatari's GUI - the device dialog">
</div>

<p>As Hatari currently only supports printing to file, click on <span
 class="button">Select</span> to select the file to print to. You can
enter a new filename as well.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> As the printer emulation is not perfect yet,
activated printer support may interfere with the emulated sound.
This is due to the fact that the Atari ST uses some general I/O ports
of the soundchip for the printer port. The Hatari team suggests to
disable printing while using games and demos.
</p>
<p>Check the second checkmark if you want to enable experimental RS232
support. The RS232 device is configured according to the settings of
the emulated RS232 of the Atari ST. This means Hatari will
automatically use baudrate and handshaking as configured for the
emulated ST.</p>
<p>Select a suitable device file for input and output. Click on <span
 class="button">Browse</span> to select.
A good choice is /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1.
</p>
<p>You can enable MIDI as well. This currently works for outputting
MIDI data only. A good choice is /dev/midi00.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to select a suitable
MIDI device file for output.</p>
<p>Your sound driver must support MIDI to make this work.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> RS232 and MIDI emulation are very experimental, too.
Don't enable them unless you really need them!

<p> The <span class="key">right CTRL</span> key is used by default as the
fire button of the emulated joystick when you turn on joystick emulation
via keyboard. </p>
<p> The cursor keys will be used by default as the emulated ST joystick,
unless you are using joystick emulation via a real joystick or have disabled
joystick emulation completely. Then the cursor keys will act as the cursor
keys of the emulated Atari ST, of course.</p>

<a name="Emulated mouse"></a><h3>Emulated mouse</h3>

<p>For obvious reasons your PC mouse will act as the emulated Atari ST
mouse. In fullscreen mode it will act as expected, directly controlling
the ST mouse pointer. </p>
<p>However it is a little bit different in windowed mode. To make the
mouse work there as expected you need to grab it first or lock it into
the Hatari window. Do this by pressing the <span class="key">ALTGR+m</span>
hotkey combination.
Press it again to go back to normal mouse behaviour which allows you to
work in other X11 windows while Hatari is up and running. </p>
<p>Mouse scrollwheel will act as cursor up and down keys. </p>

<a name="Emulated joystick"></a><h3>Emulated joystick</h3>

<p>The Atari ST joysticks are emulated ofcourse allowing you to play
your favourite games with Hatari. </p>
<p>The default mode is to use a connected PC joystick. You can use any
joystick that is supported by your kernel. If your joystick works with
other applications, it will likely work with Hatari as well. Make sure
it is calibrated and then off you go. Move the stick to point into the
desired direction. Please note that Hatari will not detect analogue
movement as the Atari ST only had digital joysticks. The first
firebutton will act as the normal firebutton on the Atari ST while the
second
firebutton will emulate a keypress of the <span class="key">SPACE</span>
key on the ST as many ST
games utilitze the SPACE bar for secondary game functions. (Xenon for
example)</p>
<p>If you do not have a PC joystick or joypad, then you do not need to
desperate. You can emulate one of the two Atari ST joysticks via the
cursor keys. Just activate it in the GUI. Then the cursor keys will act
as the joystick directions, the right CTRL key will act as the
firebutton. You can still use the cursor keys as the ST's
cursorkeys in this mode as long as you press <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
along with the cursorkeys. </p>

<a name="Emulated video"></a><h3>Emulated video</h3>

<p>Hatari by default only handles ST modes, ST-LOW, ST-MED and ST-HIGH.</p>
<p>Overscan effects and socalled "Border Removal" are possible too.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that these effects are achieved by using quirks and
glitches in the original chips to do things beyond their specification
emulation is a bit tricky for these and not all ST applications
utilizing these techniques will work properly in Hatari.
Especially socalled "Sync Scrolling", a special technique to emulate
the low byte of the video address, currently does not work properly in
Hatari.
</p>
<p>Beside that you can setup extended VDI modes. These only work with
GEM-compliant applications and they are equal to fitting a videocard
into your Mega ST.</p>
<p>Make sure to disable extended VDI modes for playing games as 99% of
all ST games will not be able to make use of higher resolutions.</p>

<a name="Emulated printer"></a><h3>Emulated printer</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that printer handling is very different between Unix
style machines and the Atari ST, emulation
of the printer is achieved by writing all printer output to a file.</p>
<p>The file will contain a sequence of data, the same that would appear
on the data pins of the Atari ST printer port.
That would include control characters and commands for graphic
printing. Clicking "Print desktop" on the GEM desktop would result
in a messy data dump in the printer output.</p>
<p>Printer emulation works best for plain text files or programs that
do not format the output for a specific printer.
The file contents can be used with your favourite text editor for
further processing and printing to a real printer.</p>
<p>To get real direct printing out of Hatari on a PostScript printer,
you may set up a GDOS printer with a PostScript driver on the emulated
Atari and set your printer device file as Hatari's printer output.<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> This has not been tested yet and the Hatari team cannot
guarantee that it will work.</p>

<a name="Emulated RS232"></a><h3>Emulated RS232</h3>

<p>Serial communications in Hatari is designed to directly use a serial
port on your PC.</p>
<p>Communications parameters are set automatically upon the settings of
the emulated ST. This means all you do is to set
the communication parameters like baudrate from your ST communications
software. Hatari will do the rest and handle
the serial input and output for you.</p>

<a name="Floppy disk images"></a><h2>Floppy disk images</h2>

<p>Hatari does not use floppy disks directly but disk images due to
differences between the floppy disk controllers of the ST and the PC.
Three types of disk images are currently supported: The raw "ST" type,
the similar "DIM" type and
the compressed "MSA" (Magic-Shadow-Archiver) type. </p>
<p> The raw type (file suffix should be "*.st") is simply a sector by
sector image of a real floppy disk. You can easily create such an image
with the <span class="commandline">dd</span> program which should
normally be pre-installed on every
Unix-like system. Simply type something like <span class="commandline">dd
if=/dev/fd0 of=myimage.st</span> to create a disk image. Of course you
need access to
/dev/fd0, and depending on your system and the type of floppy disk you
might have to use another device name here (for example I use
/dev/fd0u720 for 720kB disks). However, if the disk is copy-protected
or
doesn't use a MSDOS compatible file system, this might fail. So be very
careful if you're not sure about the disk format. </p>
<p> The other possibility is to image the disk on a real Atari ST.
There
are programs like the Magic Shadow Archiver for this task. Hatari
supports this slightly compressed MSA disk images, too. Note that
Hatari
only supports the "old" MSA format, there are some Magic Shadow
Archiver
clones (like Jay-MSA) that create better compressed but
Hatari-incompatible disk images. However, if you have got such a MSA
disk and want to use it with Hatari, you can still run the
corresponding
MSA program within Hatari to extract the incompatible disk image to a
normal floppy disk image. </p>
<p> While *.ST and *.MSA are more or less the "standard" types of Atari
disk images, you might sometimes also find STT or ADF images on the
internet. These currently do not work with Hatari. </p>
<p>Hatari can now also utilize *.DIM images just as *.ST ones without
any problems.
Note that DIM images are nearly the same as the raw ST images
(they only have an additional 32 bytes header), so you can easily
transform
the DIM images into ST images by stripping the header from the files.
For example try something like:
<span class="commandline">dd if=input.dim of=output.st bs=32 skip=1</span>
</p>
<p> If you've got a disk image that has been created with the old ST
emulator PaCifiST (for DOS) or with early versions of the program
Makedisk, and the disk image does not work with Hatari, then the disk
probably suffers from the "PaCifiST bootsector bug" (Hatari will
display a
warning message then). In this case, the bootsector of the disk
contains some illegal data, so that the disk even does not work on a
real ST any more. However, if it is a .ST and not a .MSA disk, you can
easily fix it by using a hex-editor to change the byte at offset $D
(13)
from 0 to 1 (don't forget to backup your disk image first, since you
can also easily destroy your disk image when changing a wrong byte
there). If the disk contains a bootsector program, you probably have to
adjust the boot sector check sum, too (it can be found at offset $1FE +
$1FF). </p>
<p>Hatari supports disk images that are compressed with (Pk-)ZIP
(file suffix must be ".zip") or GZip (file suffix must be ".st.gz" or
".msa.gz"), so you can archive your disk images into zip archives.
You can also directly run the zip archives you may download from the
net as long as the archive contains a disk image in .ST or .MSA format.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Hatari does not save disk images back to *.ZIP files
so
your highscores and savegames are lost if you load the game from such
a zipped disk image.</p>

<a name="Hard disk support"></a><h2>Hard disk support</h2>

<p>Hatari supports two ways of emulating a ST hard drive: The low-level
ACSI hard disk emulation and a GEMDOS based drive emulation. </p>

<a name="ACSI hard disk emulation"></a><h3>ACSI hard disk emulation</h3>
<p>
To use the ACSI hard disk emulation, you need a hard disk image file
with a pre-installed HD driver in it. So either try to image your old
ST hard disk or grab one from the internet (e.g. from the Hatari website).
Please note that AHDI 5.0 is the <em>only</em> hard disk driver that
is currently working and supported. Other hard disk drivers likely will not
work.
</p>
<p>
To create a new ACSI hard disk image, you can start with an empty image that
you have for example created with the following command:
<span class="commandline">dd if=/dev/zero of=hd.img bs=512 count=xxx</span>.
Then copy the complete AHDI 5.0 package to a floppy disk image, and enable
this floppy disk image and the fresh hard disk image in the emulator.
Start HDX.PRG from the floppy disk and format and partition the hard disk
with this tool. When you're finished, you have to restart the emulated system,
run AHDI.PRG from the floppy disk and HINSTALL.PRG afterwards.
With HINSTALL.PRG you can install the hard disk driver to the fresh HD image,
so you can directly boot from the hard disk image in the future.
</p>

<a name="GEMDOS based hard disk emulation"></a><h3>GEMDOS based hard disk emulation</h3>
<p>With the GEMDOS based drive emulation, you can easily "mount" a
folder from the host file system to a drive of the emulated Atari. To
use the GEMDOS based drive emulation, you should use a folder on your
hard disk that only contains files and folders with valid TOS
filenames.
That means that all files/folders should be written in capital letters
and their length mustn't exceed the 8+3 file name length limit. If you
don't want to rename all files to get capital letters, it is also
possible to store that folder on a FAT filesystem since those
filesystems are case-insensitive. </p>
<p>GEMDOS drive emulation is an easy way to share files between the
host system and the emulated Atari, but it is known to be incomplete
and
a little bit unstable, especially if you use it together with the ACSI
hard disk emulation. So if your programs complain that they could not
find/read/write files on the GEMDOS HD drive, you should try to copy
them to a floppy disk image or a real hard disk image!</p>
<p>Due to the way the GEMDOS drive emulation is implemented at the
moment, it is not possible to use a cartridge image together with
GEMDOS drive emulation. </p>
<p> Note that changing the HD-image or the GEMDOS HD-folder will reset
the emulated Atari since it is not possible to switch the hard disk
while the emulator is running. </p>

<p>
That's all for the moment.
May the fun without the price to be with you ;-) !

<a name="Introduction to Emulation"></a><h3>Introduction to Emulation</h3>

<p>Emulation via software is an art and Hatari is an example of this.</p>
<p>Emulation is to make a computer behave like a (probably) completely
different machine on the lowest possible niveau.
This includes CPU and custom chip emulation allowing software written
for the emulated machine to be run without notice.
A good emulator will run most of the software intended for the emulated
platform without trouble.
</p>
<p>
The key to emulation is to simply do those things with a software
program, the emulator, that normally chips would perform.
So you have an CPU emulator that basically consists of a large loop
that does exactly what the real thing would do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>fetch an instruction from virtual memory</li>
  <li>interpret this instruction</li>
  <li>fetch operands from the emulated registers and memory</li>
  <li>perform the operation like addition or changing the program
counter on a jump instruction</li>
  <li>writes results back into the intended registers or memory
locations</li>
  <li>increment of the program counter and loop</li>
</ul>
<p>
The typical von-Neumann CPU can be emulated very fast, stable and
error-free using such a simple loop system.
</p>
<p>
But in most cases the CPU emulation is the simplest part. Correct
emulation of the various custom chips and hardware
parts of the emulated system is much trickier.
