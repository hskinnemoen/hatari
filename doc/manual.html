<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>General description</h3>
<p>Hatari is an Atari ST emulator for Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and other
Systems which are supported by the SDL library. See Appendix B
for details on emulation in general.</p>
<p>Hatari is based on two main sources: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The WinSTon sourcecode written by Paul Bates. You can get it
from: <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/winston/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/winston/</a> </li>
  <li>The UAE's CPU core, you can download UAE
at: <a href="http://www.freiburg.linux.de/uae/">http://www.freiburg.linux.de/uae/</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>
Hatari started as an adaption of the free WinSTon source code to Linux.
(WinSTon is a ST emulator for Windows). But since WinSTon's CPU core was
written in i86 assembler, it was not possible to use it for Hatari as
Hatari is intended to be platform independent. So the UAE's CPU core was
used for Hatari instead, because this CPU core has been written in
portable C and also has some nice features like 68040 and FPU support.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>complete m68k emulation via UAE's CPU core</li>
  <li>support for EmuTOS, TOS 1.00, 1.02, 1.04, 2.05 and 2.06</li>
  <li>ST RAM size variable (512k, 1MB, 2MB and 4MB possible)</li>
  <li>most of the ST specific hardware</li>
  <li>ST Shifter with ST-High, ST-Medium and ST-Low resolutions,
overscan effects for lower border and partially in the upper, left and right border too</li>
  <li>512 colour ST palette</li>
  <li>Blitter chip emulation</li>
  <li>PSG YM2149 emulation (soundchip) including STFM samples</li>
  <li>Printer emulation on GEMDOS and Hardware level (print to file)</li>
  <li>experimental support for RS232</li>
  <li>extremely experimental MIDI support</li>
  <li>Mega ST real time clock</li>
  <li>many (but not all) raster effects </li>
  <li>IKBD emulation (keyboard, mouse and joystick) with custom keyboard mapping</li>
  <li>joystick emulation via cursor keys and joystick emulation via a
connected PC joystick</li>
  <li>FDC emulation using floppy disk images in standard formats (*.ST, *.MSA
and *.DIM)</li>
  <li>support for zipped disk images (both PkZip and Gzip)</li>
  <li>partial ACSI emulation for harddisk support</li>
  <li>GEMDOS interface driver to mount a directory as a harddrive</li>
  <li>experimental support for memory snapshots</li>
  <li>driver for extended VDI resolutions</li>
  <li>recording of sound as .WAV and .YM files</li>
  <li>screenshots in .BMP format</li>
  <li>animation capturing</li>
  <li>interlaced rendering of ST-Low and ST-Medium resolutions </li>
  <li>scaling of ST-Low and ST-Medium to 800x600 resolution </li>
</ul>
<p>
At the time of this writing there is neither a complete MMU emulation
nor support for STE specific features.
</p>

<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p> Hatari currently has the following system requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a fast PC (&gt;200MHz) </li>
  <li>some sort of Unix (preferable <a href="http://www.linux.org/">GNU/Linux</a>) </li>
  <li>the SDL library (<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>)</li>
  <li>the zLib (<a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>) for support of gzipped disk images</li>
</ul>
Hatari has been succesfully tested on the following machines:
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Linux/i86 with Kernel 2.6.6, AMD Athlon 600MHz</li>
  <li>Linux/i86 with Kernel 2.4.x, AMD Athlon 600MHz </li>
  <li>Linux/i86 with Kernel 2.2.18, Pentium MMX 200MHz </li>
  <li>Linux/PPC with Kernel 2.4.x BeOS/i86 </li>
  <li>Linux/Sparc</li>
  <li>Apple PowerMac with Mac OS X </li>
  <li>NetBSD 1.6 </li>
  <li>FreeBSD 4.1 on a 33MHz i486 computer (very slow, but it worked!) </li>
  <li>FreeBSD 4.8 on a Pentium 4</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiling and running</h2>

<h3>Compiling Hatari</h3>
<p> First, you need the SDL library, you can get it at:
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org/</a>. Most distributions already ship a suitable version.
Make sure to install the appropriate header files as well often called "libsdl-dev" or the like.
</p>
<p> Second, you need the zLib compression library. You can get it from <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>
but the version shipped with your distribution will be sufficient in most cases. Make sure to have the header files
for it installed as well.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you need the GNU C compiler and (GNU) Make, too!
</p>

<p> Change to the hatari/ directory and adapt the configuration file <span class="file">Makefile.cnf</span> to suite your
mood (and system of course). Then compile Hatari by typing <span class="commandline">make</span>. If all
works fine, you'll get the executable <span class="commandline">hatari</span> in the src/ subdirectory.
</p>

<h3>Installation of a TOS ROM</h3>
<p> Then you'll have to copy a TOS ROM to the data directory (the data directory is specified
in the configuration file Makefile.cnf) and rename it to <span class="commandline">tos.img</span>, or use the
<span class="commandline">--tos</span> command line option to tell Hatari where to find a TOS ROM.
Hatari needs a TOS ROM image because this contains the operating system
of the emulated Atari. Sorry, it is not possible to ship an image with
the Hatari package since these images are still copyrighted. But you can
easily create an image with a real ST and one of those various
ROM-image programs for the ST. Or search the internet, but don't ask the Hatari team
where to find one.
</p>
<p> Another solution is EmuTOS, which is an open-source
TOS clone. You can find EmuTOS at: <a href="http://emutos.sourceforge.net/">http://emutos.sourceforge.net/</a>. It's
not the best solution for playing games or running other old software
due to compatibility issues, but it's free and officially compatible with Hatari! </p>
<p>If you do not specify a TOS image on the commandline nor can Hatari
find a suitable TOS image in the default dir, you'll get the chance to
select a TOS image file from the GUI. </p>

<h3>Installation of the binary</h3>
<p> Type <span class="commandline">make install</span> as root to do a systemwide installation. In this case it is recommended
to set the DATADIR variable in Makefile.cnf to a proper value. <tt>/usr/local/share/hatari</tt> is a good value in that case.</p>
<p>The Hatari executable should now be in your PATH and accessible from anywhere.</p>

<p> When you finally have got a TOS image, try starting Hatari with the
option <span class="commandline">--help</span> to find out more about its command line parameters. </p>

<h3>Running Hatari for the first time</h3>
<p> Now type <span class="commandline">hatari</span> to run the emulator for the first time. If all goes
well, you should now be presented with a window showing you the familiar
little green desktop of the Atari ST. Press <span class="key">F12</span> to turn on the GUI to
configure Hatari to suit your needs, press <span class="key">F11</span> to toggle windowed and fullscreen mode. </p>

<h2>Command line options</h2>
<p> Hatari ofcourse understands several command line options. </p>
<p> Type <span class="commandline">hatari --help</span> to list them all. </p>
<p> The command line options in detail are as follows (in brackets the
long version): </p>

<h2>Using the emulated system</h2>
<p> Once you've started Hatari succesfully, you can use the emulator as
an allmost complete Atari ST computer system. </p>

<h3>The GUI</h3>

<h4>General usage</h4>
<p>Press <span class="key">F12</span> to enter the GUI. Navigate it with the mouse.
The GUI is rather self explanatory.</p>
<p>Click <span class="button">Okay</span> to go back to the emulated ST. All checked options will be applied.</p>
<p>Check the <span class="button">Reset ST</span> option if you want the emulated ST to perform a soft reset. This should be equal to pressing the reset button on your ST.
</p>
<p>Click <span class="button">Quit</span> to terminate Hatari and return to the host OS.</p>
<p>Click <span class="button">Cancel</span> to abandon any changes made.</p>

<h4>The System Dialog</h4>
<p>Check the CPU type to use here, enable prefetch mode and if the Blitter should be active.</p>
<p>For best Atari ST compatibility choose plain 68000 here.</p>
<p>The Timer-D patch changes the Timer-D initialization from TOS. TOS uses Timer-D as a baudrate generator for RS232.
The TOS default slows the emulation down so the patch gives you a faster emulation.
</p>
<p>You can disable the Timer-D patch if games or demos require the original TOS setting.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> These parameters are very sensitive to the emulated ST and it is strongly recommended to
reset the emulated ST after changing these options.</p>

<h4>The Discs Dialog</h4>
<p>Use the upper dialog to choose which floppy disks should be emulated in the disk drives.</p>
<p>You can use most standard Atari ST disk image files. See the chapter "Floppy disk images"
for details.</p>
<p>Click on the button <span class="button">Browse</span> next to the A: and B: option to go to the fileselector.
You may select and browse zipped disk images as well.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Eject</span> to eject a disk image from the emulated drive. The emulated ST will act as if had no floppy disk in its drive.</p>
<p>You can specify a default directory where Hatari will start to browse the filesystem.</p>
<p>Check the "Auto insert B" option if you want Hatari to be smart and insert the second disk
of a two disk game automatically. This option will insert the second disk in drive B and some
games may not be able to find the disks there. In that rare case you will need to insert the
second disk manually when prompted.</p>
<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> This option does not always work properly.
</p>

<p>If you need to create a new blank disk image, click on <span class="button">Create disk image</span>.
Parameters for the new image can be set in the following dialog. Click on <span class="create">create</span> to create the image or on <span class="button">back</span> to get back to the
disk dialog.
</p>
<p>
After clicking <span class="button">create</span>, a fileselector appears. You can browse the filesystem now. Select the target directory, click beside File:
and typein a name for the new disk image. The name should terminate with .st.
</p>
<p>Hatari can currently create plain .ST disk images exclusively.</p>

<p>Use the lower dialog to change the harddisk settings.</p>
<p>You can select a harddrive image for harddrive emulation via image file here or you may select
a directory of your local filesystem to be emulated as the ST's harddrive.</p>
<p>Check "Boot from HD" if you want Hatari to execute the AUTO folder on the harddrive.
This option is checked by default if you specify a harddrive image or a directory via the command line.</p>

<h4>The Memory Dialog</h4>
<p>You can select the amount of RAM for the emulated ST here.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This option is critical and you are strongly advised to reset the emulated ST
when changing this option.</p>
<p>Here you will find the options to save memory snapshots as well.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Save</span> to save a memory snapshot to file. You can select a new filename here.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Restore</span> to restore a memory snapshot from a file. Use the fileselector to select the snapshot to be restored.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> Memory snapshots should be considered <span style="color:red;">EXPERIMENTAL</span> and the Hatari team strongly advises you not to rely on them yet!</p>

<h4>The TOS/GEM Dialog</h4>
<p>Here you can select the TOS image to use. Click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to select it via the fileselector.</p>
<p>In the GEM setup you can select a larger resolution for GEM conformant apps. Select resolution
and colour depth. Almost all games and demos will not work in one of these resolutions.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> These options are critical and you are strongly advised to reset the emulated ST
when changing one of these option.</p>

<h4>The Joystick Dialog</h4>
<p>Here you can select which joystick you want to emulate via the cursor keys.</p>
<p>Joystick 1 is the normal ST joystick port and 99.9% of all ST games use this port, Joystick 0
emulates a joystick plugged into the ST mouse port allowing you to play 2 player games.</p>
<p>If no joystick is checked here, joystick emulation is done via a connected PC joystick.</p>
<p>See the chapter "Emulated Joystick" for details.</p>

<h4>The Screen Dialog</h4>
<p>Here you control the video output of the emulated ST.</p>
<p>Check "Fullscreen" to run Hatari fullscreen, default is windowed.</p>
<p>Check "Interlace" if you wish to have that old TV feeling in Hatari. Every second line will be black.
This will only work in ST-MEDIUM or ST-LOW in scaled up resolutions.</p>
<p>Check "Frame Skip" to speed Hatari up if emulation is too slow. This will only draw every second ST frame
instead of the default of drawing every ST frame. Uncheck if you have a fast PC.</p>
<p>Check "Use Borders" if you wish to have the borders around the ST screen.</p>
<p>"Force 8Bpp" will force SDL to use an 8bit video mode. You don't need this for modern video cards.</p>
<p>You can select which sort of monitor to use. Check "Color" for games and demos. If you check "Mono" here,
Hatari will emulate the good old SM124 and will not allow you to switch to color modes from the running ST.
This toggle acts like a monitor switch with a color and monochrome monitor connected.</p>
<p>"ST-Low mode" will control if Hatari renders ST-LOW to a 320x200 or 640x400 PC display (with borders turned off) or 384x267 or 768x534.
Basically select this to toggle between a small or a large window.</p>
<p>Click <span class="button">Capture Screen</span> to create a screenshot in .BMP format to the current working directory or click <span class="button">Record Animation</span> to record a sequence of single screenshots.
</p>

<h4>The Keyboard Dialog</h4>
<p>Here you can select the keyboard mapping to use.</p>
<p>Two different mappings called "Symbolic" and "Scancode" are predefined.</p>
<p>You can also load a custom keymapping file here if you wish. Please note that selecting to use a custom keyboard mapping will
use the "symbolic" mapping for all keys not defined by your map file. See the supplied example mapfile on how to build your
own keyboard mapping.</p>

<h4>The Sound Dialog</h4>
<p>Here you can control the sound subsystem.</p>
<p>Check if you want emulated sound at all. Emulation is faster if sound emulation is turned off.</p>
<p>3 frequencies from low to high quality are available. Experiment a little bit to find out which fits best for your setup.
Medium quality will work ok in most cases.</p>
<p>You can select to record a piece of sound here. Check which format to use and click the button. It is a toggle button so
you will need to return to the GUI to switch sound recording off again.</p>

<h4>The Devices Dialog</h4>
<p>Check here if you want to enable experimental printer support. See the chapter "Emulated printer" for details.</p>
<p>As Hatari currently only supports printing to file, click on <span class="button">Select</span> to select the file to print to. You can enter a new filename as well.</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em> As the printer emulation is not perfect yet, activated printer support may interfere with the emulated sound.
This is due to the fact that the Atari ST uses some general I/O ports of the soundchip for the printer port. The Hatari team suggests to
disable printing while using games and demos.
</p>
<p>Check the second checkmark if you want to enable experimental RS232 support. The RS232 device is configured according to the settings of the emulated RS232 of the Atari ST. This means Hatari will automatically use baudrate and handshaking as configured for the emulated ST.</p>
<p>Select a suitable device file for input and output. Click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to select.
A good choice is /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1.
</p>
<p>You can enable MIDI as well. This currently work for outputting MIDI data only.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="button">Browse</span> to select a suitable MIDI device file for output.</p>
<p>Your sound driver must support MIDI to make this work.</p>

<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<p> While the emulator is running, you can activate or toggle various
features via the following keyboard shortcuts. </p>

<h3>Emulated Atari ST keyboard</h3>
<p> All other keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so
pressing SPACE on your PC will result in an emulated press of the SPACE
key on the ST. The following keys have special meanings: </p>

<p> <span class="key">ALTGR</span> will act as ALTERNATE as well as long as you do not press it
together with a Hatari hotkey combination. </p>
<p> The <span class="key">right CTRL</span> key is used as the fire button of the emulated
joystick when you turn on joystick emulation via keyboard. </p>
<p> The cursor keys will act as the cursor keys on the Atari ST as long as joystick emulation
via keyboard has been turned off.</p>

<h3>Emulated mouse</h3>
<p>For obvious reasons your PC mouse will act as the emulated Atari ST
mouse. In fullscreen mode it will act as expected, directly controlling
the ST mouse pointer. </p>
<p>However it is a little bit different in windowed mode. To make the
mouse work there as expected you need to grab it first or lock it into
the Hatari window. Do this by pressing the <span class="key">ALTGR+m</span> hotkey combination.
Press it again to go back to normal mouse behaviour which allows you to
work in other X11 windows while Hatari is up and running. </p>

<h3>Emulated joystick</h3>
<p>The Atari ST joysticks are emulated ofcourse allowing you to play
your favourite games with Hatari. </p>
<p>The default mode is to use a connected PC joystick. You can use any
joystick that is supported by your kernel. If your joystick works with
other applications, it will likely work with Hatari as well. Make sure
it is calibrated and then off you go. Move the stick to point into the
desired direction. Please note that Hatari will not detect analogue
movement as the Atari ST only had digital joysticks. The first
firebutton will act as the normal firebutton on the Atari ST while the second
firebutton will emulate a keypress of the <span class="key">SPACE</span> key on the ST as many ST
games utilitze the SPACE bar for secondary game functions. (Xenon for example)</p>
<p>If you do not have a PC joystick or joypad, then you do not need to
desperate. You can emulate one of the two Atari ST joysticks via the
cursor keys. Just activate it in the GUI. Then the cursor keys will act
as the joystick directions, the right CTRL key will act as the
firebutton. You can still use the cursor keys as the ST's
cursorkeys in this mode as long as you press <span class="key">SHIFT</span> along with the cursorkeys. </p>

<h3>Emulated video</h3>
<p>Hatari by default only handles ST modes, ST-LOW, ST-MED and ST-HIGH.</p>
<p>Overscan effects and socalled "Border Removal" are possible too.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that these effects are achieved by using quirks and glitches in the original chips to do things beyond their specification emulation is a bit tricky for these and not all ST applications utilizing these techniques will work properly in Hatari.
Especially socalled "Sync Scrolling", a special technique to emulate the low byte of the video address, currently does not work properly in Hatari.
</p>
<p>Beside that you can setup extended VDI modes. These only work with GEM-compliant applications and they are equal to fitting a videocard into your Mega ST.</p>
<p>Make sure to disable extended VDI modes for playing games as 99% of all ST games will not be able to make use of higher resolutions.</p>


<h3>Emulated printer</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that printer handling is very different between Unix style machines and the Atari ST, emulation
of the printer is achieved by writing all printer output to a file.</p>
<p>The file will contain a sequence of data, the same that would appear on the data pins of the Atari ST printer port.
That would include control characters and commands for graphic printing. Clicking "Print desktop" on the GEM desktop would result
in a messy data dump in the printer output.</p>
<p>Printer emulation works best for plain text files or programs that do not format the output for a specific printer.
The file contents can be used with your favourite text editor for further processing and printing to a real printer.</p>
<p>To get real direct printing out of Hatari on a PostScript printer, you may set up a GDOS printer with a PostScript driver on the emulated Atari and set your printer device file as Hatari's printer output.<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> This has not been tested yet and the Hatari team cannot guarantee that it will work.</p>

<h3>Emulated RS232</h3>
<p>Serial communications in Hatari is designed to directly use a serial port on your PC.</p>
<p>Communications parameters are set automatically upon the settings of the emulated ST. This means all you do is to set
the communication parameters like baudrate from your ST communications software. Hatari will do the rest and handle
the serial input and output for you.</p>

<h2>Floppy disk images</h2>
<p>Hatari does not use floppy disks directly but disk images due to
differences between the floppy disk controllers of the ST and the PC.
Three types of disk images are currently supported: The raw "ST" type, the similar "DIM" type and
the compressed "MSA" (Magic-Shadow-Archiver) type. </p>
<p> The raw type (file suffix should be "*.st") is simply a sector by
sector image of a real floppy disk. You can easily create such an image
with the <span class="commandline">dd</span> program which should normally be pre-installed on every
Unix-like system. Simply type something like <span class="commandline">dd if=/dev/fd0 of=myimage.st</span> to create a disk image. Of course you need access to
/dev/fd0, and depending on your system and the type of floppy disk you
might have to use another device name here (for example I use
/dev/fd0u720 for 720kB disks). However, if the disk is copy-protected or
doesn't use a MSDOS compatible file system, this might fail. So be very
careful if you're not sure about the disk format. </p>
<p> The other possibility is to image the disk on a real Atari ST. There
are programs like the Magic Shadow Archiver for this task. Hatari
supports this slightly compressed MSA disk images, too. Note that Hatari
only supports the "old" MSA format, there are some Magic Shadow Archiver
clones (like Jay-MSA) that create better compressed but
Hatari-incompatible disk images. However, if you have got such a MSA
disk and want to use it with Hatari, you can still run the corresponding
MSA program within Hatari to extract the incompatible disk image to a
normal floppy disk image. </p>
<p> While *.ST and *.MSA are more or less the "standard" types of Atari
disk images, you might sometimes also find DIM or ADF images on the
internet. These currently do not work with Hatari. But since DIM images
are nearly the same as the raw ST images (they only have an additional
32 byte header) you can easily transform the DIM images into ST images
by stripping the header from the files. For example try something like:
<span class="commandline">dd if=input.dim of=output.st bs=32 skip=1</span> </p>
<p>Hatari now can utilize *.DIM images just as *.ST ones and you should not detect any problems.</p>
<p> If you've got a disk image that has been created with the old ST
emulator PaCifiST (for DOS) or with early versions of the program
Makedisk, and the disk image does not work with Hatari, then the disk
probably suffers from the "PaCifiST bootsector bug" (Hatari will print a
warning message then). In this case, the bootsector of the disk
contains some illegal data, so that the disk even does not work on a
real ST any more. However, if it is a .ST and not a .MSA disk, you can
easily fix it by using a hex-editor to change the byte at offset $D (13)
from 0 to 1 (don't forget to backup your disk image first, since you
can also easily destroy your disk image when changing a wrong byte
there). If the disk contains a bootsector program, you probably have to
adjust the boot sector check sum, too (it can be found at offset $1FE +
$1FF). </p>
<p>Hatari supports disk images that are compressed with (Pk-)ZIP
(file suffix must be ".zip") or GZip (file suffix must be ".st.gz" or
".msa.gz"),  so you can archive your disk images into zip archives.
You can also directly run the zip archives you may download from the
net as long as the archive contains a disk image in .ST or .MSA format.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Hatari does not save disk images back to *.ZIP files so
your highscores and savegames are lost if you load the game from such
a zipped disk image.</p>

<h2>Hard disk support</h2>
<p>Hatari supports two ways of emulating a ST hard drive: The low-level
ACSI hard disk emulation and a GEMDOS based drive emulation. </p>
<p>To use the ACSI hard disk emulation, you need a hard disk image file
with a pre-installed HD driver in it. So either try to image your old ST
hard disk or grab one from the internet. There is a HD image on the
Hatari web page for download. Perhaps we'll also provide a tool for
creating HD images one day. </p>
<p>With the GEMDOS based drive emulation, you can easily "mount" a
folder from the host file system to a drive of the emulated Atari. To
use the GEMDOS based drive emulation, you should use a folder on your
hard disk that only contains files and folders with valid TOS filenames.
That means that all files/folders should be written in capital letters
and their length mustn't exceed the 8+3 file name length limit. If you
don't want to rename all files to get capital letters, it is also
possible to store that folder on a FAT filesystem since those
filesystems are case-insensitive. </p>
<p>GEMDOS drive emulation is an easy way to share files between the
host system and the emulated Atari, but it is known to be incomplete and
a little bit unstable, especially if you use it together with the ACSI
hard disk emulation. So if your programs complain that they could not
find/read/write files on the GEMDOS HD drive, you should try to copy
them to a floppy disk image or a real hard disk image! </p>
<p> Note that changing the HD-image or the GEMDOS HD-folder will reset
the emulated Atari since it is not possible to switch the hard disk
while the emulator is running. </p>
<p> May the fun without the price to be with you ;-) ! </p>

<h3>Introduction to Emulation</h3>
<p>Emulation via software is an art and Hatari is an example of this.</p>
<p>Emulation is to make a computer behave like a (probably) completely different machine on the lowest possible niveau.
This includes CPU and custom chip emulation allowing software written for the emulated machine to be run without notice.
A good emulator will run most of the software intended for the emulated platform without trouble.
</p>
<p>
The key to emulation is to simply do those things with a software program, the emulator, that normally chips would perform.
So you have an CPU emulator that basically consists of a large loop that does exactly what the real thing would do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch an instruction from virtual memory</li>
<li>interpret this instruction</li>
<li>fetch operands from the emulated registers and memory</li>
<li>perform the operation like addition or changing the program counter on a jump instruction</li>
<li>writes results back into the intended registers or memory locations</li>
<li>increment of the program counter and loop</li>
</ul>
<p>
The typical von-Neumann CPU can be emulated very fast, stable and error-free using such a simple loop system.
</p>
<p>
But in most cases the CPU emulation is the simplest part. Correct emulation of the various custom chips and hardware
parts of the emulated system is much trickier.
</p>
