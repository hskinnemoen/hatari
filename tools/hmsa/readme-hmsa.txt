 Hatari tool: Magic Shadow (Un-)Archiver
 Version 0.2.0
 Written by: Thomas Huth <huth@users.berlios.de>


This little program converts Atari MSA disk images into ST disk images and
vice versa. It's just a very quick'n'dirty hack at the moment, it might
not always work as expected - so better make a back-up of your disk images
first!

Usage: The program accepts only one parameter - the file name of a MSA or
ST disk image. This image will then be converted to the other disk image
format.
